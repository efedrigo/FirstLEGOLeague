Write a micro-python script for pybricks to drive a differential drive robot with accessories. 
The script defines a function called mission1 that receives as argument an object called "myRobot". 
The object "myRobot" contains the following members:
- motorLeft: the left motor of the differential drive robot
- motorRight: the right motor of the differential drive robot
- accessoryLeft: the motor for the left accessory
- accessoryRight: the motor for the right accessory
- axle: the distance betweehn the wheels
- wheelDiameter: the diameter of each wheel

When generating the script use the following instructions:
- do not use "curve" to drive an arc, since this function has been replaced by "arc".
- when moving the accessories and the wheels in parallel, use the non-blocking version of "straight" or "arc" or "turn"
- if no parallel motion of the accessories is needed, use the blocking version of "straight", "arc" or "turn"
- run_until_stalled is blocking so you cannot move two accessories in parallel. Use "dc" instead, with a duty cycle of 50%
- for the accessory motions, adds a variable for each motor so that the sign can be customised
- for this script, start with a negative sign for both accessory motors 
- pybricks does not have the library "math" available, use "umath" instead
- define 3 speed levels: fast at 600 mm/s, medium at 300 mm/s and slow at 100 mm/s

The script shall:
- initialise the pybricks DriveBase object, make sure the gyroscope is used to control motion
- fast drive the robot straight for 620mm 
- while driving, move in parallel to the motion both accessory in parallel until they reach a mechanical stop, the reset their position
- ensure the accessories reach the mechanical stop before driving further
- turn the robot 90 degrees to the left
- then slow move straight at medium speed for 250mm
- then lower the left accessory to 100 degrees, without moving
- then raise the left accessory to 0 degrees, without moving
- then slow move straight back for 200mm
- then turn 45 degrees to the right 
- then lower the right accessory to 100 degrees
- then move straight 200mm at medium speed
- then raise the right accessory to 0 degrees, without moving
- then move straight back 200mm at medium speed
- then turn in the direction of the initial position
- then fast move straight to return to the initial position
