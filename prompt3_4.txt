Write a micro-python script for pybricks to drive a differential drive robot with accessories. 
The script defines a function called mission3_4 that receives as argument an object called "myRobot". 
The object "myRobot" contains the following members:
- motorLeft: the left motor of the differential drive robot
- motorRight: the right motor of the differential drive robot
- driveBase: the pybricks DriveBase already initialised
- accessoryLeft: the motor for the left accessory
- accessoryRight: the motor for the right accessory

The script shall:
- drive the robot straight for 900mm at 500mm/s
- while driving, move in parallel to the motion both accessory in parallel until they reach a mechanical stop, the reset their position
- then drive an arc of 90 degrees to the right at 50mm/s, radius 40mm.
- while driving the arc and before the next motion, lower the left accessory to 800 degrees and the right accessory to 190 degrees
- then move straight at 100mm/s for 50mm
- then raise the left accessory to 750degrees and the right accessory back to 0
- then move straight back at 100mm/s for 50mm
- then another arc of 90 degrees to the right 
- then fast straight 900mm to go back to the initial position

Please note: 
- the method straight in DriveBase is not blocking. 
- the curve in the last version of pybricks is done with the method arc which is not blocking
